## Overview

Toaster Eats is an example web application that looks to improve the nutritional content and variety of foods eaten by students and help them limit the use of vending machines or fast food products by providing tasty, realistic alternatives. It illustrates various technologies useful to ICS software engineering students, including:

- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
